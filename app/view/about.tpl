            <p>My name is Juan Segura and it is my pleasure to be representing Beta Theta Pi in the Virginia Tech’s 2018 Homecoming Court.
              I am a senior studying Computer Science and I am from Gainesville, Va.
              I have been involved in different organizations across campus ranging Hokie Ambassadors to Swim Club.
              Throughout my time in Beta, I have taken a wide variety of different leadership positions such as Fundraising Chair and Risk Manager.</p>

              <p>I love this opportunity to lead my organization on Homecoming Court because it gives all of my brothers
                and I a chance to give back to both the Virginia Tech and the Special Needs community.
                For the past couple years that I’ve been at VT, I have always been amazed at the level of enthusiasm that the students here have to give back to the community.
                This is our opportunity to truly live out Ut Prosim and represent what it means to be a Hokie.</p>

        <h2 class="about">What does Homecoming mean to me?</h2>
        <p>One of the most influential people in my life was my cousin, Martin. Martin suffered from a type
        of Leukodystrophy that impaired his nervous system and deteriorated his motor skills. As kids,
        my cousins and I would try to include Martin when we played, but, unfortunately, this wasn’t
        always possible. Through my campaign, I hope to not only give these kids the fun they deserve
        but also shift the focus away from what they can’t do and instead showcase what they can. This
        campaign is my chance to make Martin, and all of these amazing kids like him, proud.</p>
