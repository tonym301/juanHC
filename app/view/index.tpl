			<p>My goal is to bring awareness and support to special education departments in public schools around the Blacksburg area.
				With the help of my sponsoring organization, Beta Theta Pi, I will organize a field day for students held at Blacksburg High School.
				I'm partnering up with Blacksburg High, Middle, and Elementary schools to create this all day event! Through this event,
				I hope to change the community’s mindset by showcasing what students with disabilities can do instead of what they can’t.</p>

				<p>The money that I raise will be split between buying equipment for the field day and buying food for the students.
				We’ll be creating a wide variety of activities to give each kid a chance to really enjoy themselves.
				There will be carnival games, arts and crafts, and some sports such as inflatable soccer, basketball, volleyball, and many more!</p>

				<p>Join me to take a Stand for these incredible students to give each kid a chance to enjoy being a kid.
				Virginia Tech students can vote on Gobbler Connect and can find the link for that
