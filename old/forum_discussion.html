        <p>On the second day of the battle, the Marines stormed towards the airfield at Peleliu. Despite the Japanese artillery and pillboxes the airfield was taken and held during this period. Aircraft soon began to land at the airfield during this period to provide the Marines with further aerial reconnaissance. By the 26th September, F4U Corsairs began to land at the airstrip for further dive-bombing missions around Peleliu.</p>
