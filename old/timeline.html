          <h2>September 4th, 1944</h2>
          <p>On the 4th September, the Marines left their bases at Pavauu. Before they arrived the U.S. Navy bombarded Peleliu with their battleships and cruisers. In addition to this, light aircraft carriers also supported the bombardment. Aside from the Japanese aircraft that were wiped out, the bombardment did not have that much impact.

          <p>On the second day of the battle, the Marines stormed towards the airfield at Peleliu. Despite the Japanese artillery and pillboxes the airfield was taken and held during this period. Aircraft soon began to land at the airfield during this period to provide the Marines with further aerial reconnaissance. By the 26th September, F4U Corsairs began to land at the airstrip for further dive-bombing missions around Peleliu.
